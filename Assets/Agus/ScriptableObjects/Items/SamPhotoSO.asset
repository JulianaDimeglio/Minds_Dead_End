  displayName: Torn Sam photo piece
  description: "A torn piece of an old photograph. It shows a boy\u2014maybe ten
    years old\u2014with a faint, familiar smile. He wears suspenders and stands tall,
    as if trying to seem older than he is. The more you look, the harder it is to
    deny: this is you. Why are you in this picture? Why can\u2019t you remember it?"
